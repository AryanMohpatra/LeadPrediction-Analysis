SALES CONVERSION PREDICTION - UPDATED EDA SUMMARY REPORT
=========================================================

1. DATA OVERVIEW
----------------
- Dataset Shape: 9240 rows × 37 columns
- Target Variable: 'Converted' (0 = Not Converted, 1 = Converted)
- Total Features: 36

2. MISSING VALUE ANALYSIS
--------------------------
- Major missing features:
    • Lead Quality: 4767 missing
    • Asymmetrique Activity/Profile Scores & Indexes: ~4218 missing each
    • Tags, Lead Profile, Occupation, Country, etc. have 25-50% missing
- Suggestion: Drop columns with high missing values or impute where meaningful

3. DATA TYPES
--------------
- Numeric: TotalVisits, Total Time Spent on Website, Page Views Per Visit
- Categorical: Lead Source, Origin, Specialization, Activity, etc.

4. TARGET DISTRIBUTION
-----------------------
- Converted = 0 (Not Converted): ~61.5%
- Converted = 1 (Converted): ~38.5%
- Slight class imbalance, consider stratified split

5. UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
-----------------------
- TotalVisits, Page Views Per Visit are highly right-skewed
- Lead Origin, Lead Source, Specialization have dominant categories

6. BIVARIATE ANALYSIS
----------------------
- Leads with higher time spent and more visits are more likely to convert
- Certain lead sources and last activities have higher conversion rates

7. CORRELATION ANALYSIS
------------------------
- TotalVisits, Page Views, and Time Spent are positively correlated with each other
- Converted is moderately correlated with Total Time Spent

8. SKEWNESS ANALYSIS
---------------------
- Page Views Per Visit: skew = 3.22 (very high)
- TotalVisits: skew = 1.58 (high)
- Log transformation applied to correct skew

9. OUTLIER DETECTION
---------------------
- IQR method applied to:
    • TotalVisits
    • Total Time Spent on Website
    • Page Views Per Visit
- Significant outliers detected and visualized using boxplots
- Outliers removed to improve model robustness

10. MULTICOLLINEARITY (VIF)
----------------------------
- PageViewsPerVisit_Log: VIF = 25.8 (very high)
- TotalVisits_Log, TotalTimeSpent_Log also >10
- These features show strong multicollinearity and are dropped

11. CATEGORY SIMPLIFICATION
----------------------------
- Rare categories in: Lead Source, Specialization, City, Last Activity
- Categories <1% frequency grouped as 'Other'

12. FINAL CLEANING ACTIONS
---------------------------
- Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns based on missingness/VIF
- Applied log transformation and outlier filtering to skewed features
- Simplified high-cardinality categorical columns
- Final dataset ready for modeling
